/*
What are Classes?

Classes allow you to group together all your crap (things 
like related functions, variables, etc).
For example, in a game, you can group all your functions
for character movement in a Class.

Classes can make your code a lot cleaner and easier for other
humans to read, but Classes don't really add any new functionality.
Anything that you can do with Classes you can also do without Classes!

    // PUBLIC -- Can be accessed by int main().
    // PRIVATE -- Can't be accessed by int main(). By default, a Class makes everything private.
